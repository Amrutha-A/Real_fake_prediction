# Real_fake_prediction
This is a neural network deep learning project which predicts whether the image is real or fake. It uses convolution technique. It has a sequential model of 6 convolution layer, 6 maxpool layer, flatten layer and two dense layer in the end. 
The open-source data from kaggle is used to build the model.
